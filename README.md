# Self Care Center
## Overview
How can I care for myself? One way is with affirmations and mantras!
Affirmations are thoughts of positive self-empowerment, meant to assert your self-worth.
Mantras are repetive phrases that are repeated again and again during mindfulness practices. Your challenge is to build an app that helps users remind themselves of their inherent value!

This Solo Challenge gives students and instructors the opportunity to get a pulse on where you are with the foundational concepts of Module 1 curriculum. Students should use this as an opportunity to challenge themselves and work completely independently. Google can (and probably should!) be used, but any other code base should not be referenced. Instructors will be able to use your work, both completion of functionality and code quality, to determine where you stand and if you are behind for this point in the module, provide supports to intervene.

The spec for this project can be found [here](https://frontend.turing.io/projects/module-1/self-care-center.html).

# Self-Care Center 

### Abstract:
The website allows users to randomly generate affirmations or mantras with the click of a button. Users can then save those messages to a list of favorites. Those favorites can then be deleted with a double click.

### Installation Instructions:
Simply clone down and open the index.html

### Preview of App:
Star emoji changes from grey when unfavorited, to yellow if favorited.

### Context:
This project took only a few hours of work time, with the majority of that time spent on the CSS styling.

### Contributors:
Just me.

### Learning Goals:
This taught me a lot about CSS and HTML. This was my first time really working with either, and it took some time to get it to a place I liked.

### Wins + Challenges:
The star emoji pictured above was something small, but getting it to work made me immensely happy. Also, the initial functionality of the website--that is, generating random messages--didn't take me very long and was clear to me the whole way through. As for challenges, the biggest was CSS. It simply took some time and experimentation before I was able to get things where I wanted them to be.
