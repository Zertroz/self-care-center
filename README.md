# Self-Care Center 

### Abstract:
The website allows users to randomly generate affirmations or mantras with the click of a button. Users can then save those messages to a list of favorites. Those favorites can then be deleted with a double click.

### Installation Instructions:
Simply clone down and open the index.html

### Preview of App:
Star emoji changes from grey when unfavorited, to yellow if favorited.

### Context:
This project took only a few hours of work time, with the majority of that time spent on the CSS styling.

### Contributors:
Just me.

### Learning Goals:
This taught me a lot about CSS and HTML. This was my first time really working with either, and it took some time to get it to a place I liked.

### Wins + Challenges:
The star emoji pictured above was something small, but getting it to work made me immensely happy. Also, the initial functionality of the website--that is, generating random messages--didn't take me very long and was clear to me the whole way through. As for challenges, the biggest was CSS. It simply took some time and experimentation before I was able to get things where I wanted them to be.
